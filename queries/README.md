# lungmap-scratch queries
*a directory to store reproducible queries that shape the direction of research*

![mail](images/lungmap.png)


## How this works
Throughtout this project, we will test several hypotheses about the way in which data was captured and methods that could possible be used based on the organization of data. The aim of this directory is to capture those questions, the scripts that are used to investigate, and the decision points based on that query.

Each query will have it's own folder that contains code used to investigate the question or hypothesis under investigation. Users should update the table below to indicate the:
- Question/hypothesis
- Folder where information is stored
- decision points based on investigation
- notes


## queries
|Question/Hypothesis|Folder/Location|Decision|Notes|
|-------------------|---------------|--------|-----|
|Are images part of a 3D segment (can they be stacked)?|[./image_stacking](./image_stacking)|TBD|Need to get clarification from LungMap|
